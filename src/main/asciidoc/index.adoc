[[overview-http-status-codes]]
== HTTP status codes

RESTful notes tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information

| `401 Unauthorized`
| Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided. The response must include a WWW-Authenticate header field containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource. See Basic access authentication and Digest access authentication.[34] 401 semantically means "unauthenticated",[35] i.e. the user does not have the necessary credentials.

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist

| `500 Internal Server Error`
| A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable
